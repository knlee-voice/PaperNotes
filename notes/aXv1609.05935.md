TLDR;  


#### Key Points

- In Image classification we can apply adversarial training directly to the inputs. In Text classification the inputs are discrete and we cannot make small perturbations, but we can instead apply adversarial training to embeddings.

#### Thoughts

- I think this is a very well-written paper with impressive results. The only thing that's lacking is a bit of consistency. Sometimes pure virtual adversarial training wins, and sometimes adversarial + virtual adversarial wins. Sometimes bi-LSTMs make things worse, sometimes better. What is the story behind that? Do we really need to try all combinations to figure out what works for a given dataset?
